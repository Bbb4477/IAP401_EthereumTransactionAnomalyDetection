# Ethereum Fraud Detection System

Welcome to the **Ethereum Transaction Anomaly Detection** project. This repository contains a system designed to detect fraudulent activity in Ethereum smart contracts, addresses, and transactions. By combining machine learning models with transaction history analysis and smart contract source code evaluation, this project aims to identify suspicious patterns and enhance security within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Project Overview
The Ethereum blockchain, while powerful, is susceptible to fraudulent activities such as malicious smart contracts, phishing addresses, and irregular transactions. This project addresses these challenges by:
- **Transaction Analysis**: Using machine learning to analyze transaction histories and detect anomalies based on patterns like frequency, volume, or unusual token transfers.
- **Smart Contract Inspection**: Examining smart contract source code for vulnerabilities or malicious behavior using static analysis tools.
- **Etherscan Integration**: Leveraging the Etherscan API to collect real-time transaction data and contract metadata for model training and analysis.

The system builds on existing work, including machine learning models, packaged code, and Etherscan API integration, to provide a robust framework for fraud detection.

## Key Components
1. **Data Collection**: Fetches transaction histories and smart contract details using the Etherscan API.
2. **Machine Learning Models**: Trains models to distinguish between normal and fraudulent behavior based on features like transaction frequency, token types, and time intervals.
3. **Code Analysis**: Processes smart contract source code to identify potential security risks or malicious patterns.
4. **Output**: Generates reports flagging suspicious addresses, transactions, or contracts for further investigation.

## Purpose
This project was developed to improve Ethereum blockchain security by providing a practical tool for detecting fraud. It combines machine learning and blockchain analysis to offer actionable insights for developers, researchers, and security professionals.
